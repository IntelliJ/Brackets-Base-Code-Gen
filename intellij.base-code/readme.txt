THIS IS AN EXTENSION FOR THE OPEN-SOURCE CODE EDITOR 'BRACKETS' (http://brackets.io/)

THIS EXTENSION IS FREE TO USE, EDIT AND REPRODUCE.

THIS EXTENSION IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A WAY TO INSERT THE 'BASE HTML CODE' INTO YOUR FILE MUCH LIKE DREAMWEAVER DOES.

THIS EXTENSION WAS CREATED BECAUSE THIS WAS THE ONLY FUNCTIONALITY DREAMWEAVER HAD THAT PREVENTED ME FROM SWITCHING OVER TO BRACKETS FULLY.

(Yes... I'm lazy)
